I've been wanting to get around to blogging for awhile now, mostly just to document the development process of my past and future projects, as well as to help reinforce concepts as I learn them. 

I plan to start a small series of posts about my recently completed CHIP-8 game console [CHIPnGo](https://github.com/kurtjd/CHIPnGo) to kick things off, so stay tuned!
